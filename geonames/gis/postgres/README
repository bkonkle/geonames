If you need to process GIS data, follow these
instructions. Note you don't need this
if you are not going to do proximity searches.
Note you need to do this before importing
any data.

First of all, you need postgis, which adds
support for GIS data types to postgresql.
Some distributions include packages, but if
that's not the case for you, download
it from http://postgis.refractions.net/
and follow the installation instructions
from the documentation.

Next, execute the following commands
(add username/password/host as needed):

createlang plpgsql [yourdatabase]
psql -d [yourdatabase] -f lwpostgis.sql
psql -d [yourdatabase] -f spatial_ref_sys.sql

(lwpostgis.sql and spatial_ref_sys.sql are distributed
with postgis)

This will create the spatial fields as well
as a trigger for keeping them updated.
psql -d [yourdatabase] < points.sql

Finally, after importing the database, run:

psql -d [yourdatabase] < indexes.sql

This will create the indexes for the
spatial fields.

If you are doing only proximity searches,
you should also cluster the table "geoname"
according to the "geoname_point" index:
(from psql console)
CLUSTER geoname_point ON geoname;
