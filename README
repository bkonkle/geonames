This is a fork of a project originally created by Alberto Garc√≠a Hierro
(https://github.com/fiam/geonames).  My goal is to add distutils packaging so
that it can be easily installed by Pip, clean up the import script and 
models so that it works on my Postgis setup, and add functions that make it
easy to forward and reverse geocode with the data.
